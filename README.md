Domain Reconnaissance Tool üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èA powerful, user-friendly GUI tool built with Python for performing reconnaissance on a target domain. It automates the discovery of subdomains, checks their live status, detects Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), and finds historical IP information, saving all findingsLive Status: Shows which subdomains are active and which are not.Detects Firewalls (WAF): Tries to identify common web application firewalls.Finds Historical IPs: Looks up past IP addresses associated with the domain.Saves Results: Automatically saves a full report to a .txt file.Easy to Use: A clean and simple graphical interface.üöÄ How to Use1. SetupFirst, clone the project and install the necessary packages.

## Usage

1.  Run the application from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python recon_kal.py
    ```

2.  A splash screen will appear for 3 seconds, followed by the main application window.

3.  Enter the target domain (e.g., `example.com`) in the input field.

4.  Click the **"Start Scan"** button or press the `Enter` key to begin.

5.  The tool will start the reconnaissance process. Output will be printed in the textbox in real-time.

6.  To stop the scan before it completes, click the **"Stop Scan"** button.

7.  Once the scan is finished (or stopped), a status message will confirm the completion, and the full results will be available in the corresponding log file (e.g., `example.com_recon_output.txt`).
